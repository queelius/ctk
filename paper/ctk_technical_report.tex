\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present the Conversation Toolkit (CTK), a comprehensive system for managing AI conversations from multiple providers in a unified format. As users increasingly interact with diverse LLM platforms---ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and coding assistants---conversations become fragmented across incompatible formats and isolated interfaces. CTK addresses this by introducing a universal tree-based conversation model that preserves structural information while enabling cross-platform operations. The system combines extensible plugin architecture, natural language query capabilities, and interactive management tools to provide a complete solution for conversation archival, organization, and analysis. We demonstrate CTK's effectiveness across multiple providers and discuss design principles for building unified interfaces to heterogeneous AI systems.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Conversation Fragmentation Problem}

The rapid adoption of large language models has created an unprecedented volume of human-AI interactions. Users engage with ChatGPT for creative writing, Claude for deep reasoning, Gemini for research, and GitHub Copilot for coding---often switching between platforms multiple times per day. Each platform maintains conversations in proprietary formats, creating several critical problems:

\textbf{Knowledge Silos}: Valuable insights, solutions, and discussions are scattered across platforms with no unified access mechanism. A user who solved a problem in ChatGPT last month cannot easily find that solution when working in Claude today.

\textbf{Platform Lock-In}: Conversations cannot be moved between providers, limiting user agency and making it difficult to compare platform capabilities on real workloads.

\textbf{Organizational Challenges}: Different platforms offer varying organizational features. ChatGPT provides folders, Claude offers search, Gemini has minimal organization. No platform provides comprehensive tagging, archival, or cross-conversation analysis.

\textbf{Research Barriers}: Studying conversational AI requires access to real conversations, but researchers face significant barriers extracting and analyzing data from multiple platforms.

\textbf{Fine-Tuning Data Preparation}: Creating training datasets from real conversations requires normalizing diverse formats, handling branching structures, and ensuring data quality---tasks that are error-prone and platform-specific.

\subsection{Core Insight: Conversations as Universal Trees}

CTK's fundamental insight is that \emph{all AI conversations can be represented as trees}, regardless of their source platform or linear/branching nature. This universality enables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear conversations as single-path trees
    \item ChatGPT regenerations as branching trees
    \item Coding assistant interactions as trees with tool calls
    \item Future multimodal conversations with the same structure
\end{itemize}

By standardizing on this representation, CTK decouples conversation \emph{storage and management} from their original \emph{source platform}, enabling operations impossible within any single platform.

\subsection{Contributions}

This work makes the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Universal Conversation Model}: A tree-based representation handling linear and branching conversations uniformly
    \item \textbf{Cross-Platform Architecture}: Plugin system enabling extensible format support without core modifications
    \item \textbf{Natural Language Interface}: LLM-powered queries using tool calling for intuitive conversation access
    \item \textbf{Integrated Management}: Combined CLI, TUI, and API supporting diverse workflows
    \item \textbf{Privacy-First Design}: Fully local operation with optional sanitization for sharing
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Conversation Management}

Existing systems address aspects of conversation management but lack CTK's unified approach:

\textbf{Platform-Specific Tools}: ChatGPT provides JSON export, Claude offers conversation download, but these are single-platform solutions requiring custom parsing and offering no management capabilities.

\textbf{LLM Application Frameworks}: LangChain~\cite{langchain} and LlamaIndex~\cite{llamaindex} focus on building applications with conversation chains but do not address archival, cross-platform compatibility, or historical conversation management.

\textbf{Local LLM Systems}: PrivateGPT and similar tools enable local model deployment but lack conversation archive functionality.

CTK differs by treating conversations as \emph{first-class knowledge artifacts} worthy of long-term management, not just ephemeral application state.

\subsection{Knowledge Management Systems}

Personal knowledge management (PKM) systems provide relevant paradigms:

\textbf{Graph-Based Notes}: Obsidian and Logseq use bidirectional links to connect notes, enabling knowledge graph construction. CTK extends this to conversational knowledge where links emerge from context and topic similarity.

\textbf{Research Management}: Zotero and Mendeley manage research papers with metadata, tags, and search. CTK applies similar principles to conversations, treating each as a document with structured metadata.

\textbf{Document Intelligence}: DevonThink combines document management with AI features. CTK specializes this for the unique characteristics of conversations: temporal ordering, branching structure, and turn-taking.

\subsection{Tree-Structured Data}

CTK's tree model draws inspiration from established systems:

\textbf{Version Control}: Git's directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) track code evolution with branching and merging. CTK adapts this concept to conversation evolution, where ``branches'' represent regenerations or alternative responses.

\textbf{Hierarchical Data}: File systems, XML documents, and abstract syntax trees demonstrate the power of tree structures for organizing complex information. Conversations naturally fit this paradigm with parent-child message relationships.

\textbf{Conversation Trees in RL}: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)~\cite{rlhf} uses tree-structured conversation rollouts. CTK generalizes this structure for general-purpose conversation management.

\section{Core Concepts}
\label{sec:concepts}

\subsection{The Conversation Tree Model}

A conversation is represented as a tree $T = (M, E)$ where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $M$ is a set of messages, each with unique identifier, role (user/assistant/system), content, and timestamp
    \item $E \subseteq M \times M$ is a set of directed edges $(m_i, m_j)$ indicating message $m_j$ is a response to $m_i$
    \item One or more root messages $R \subseteq M$ have no parents
    \item Leaf messages $L \subseteq M$ have no children
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Properties}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Acyclic}: The tree structure prevents circular references
    \item \textbf{Temporal}: Edges respect temporal ordering (parent precedes child)
    \item \textbf{Multi-rooted}: Supports rare cases of multiple initial messages
    \item \textbf{Content-Rich}: Messages contain text, images, audio, video, tool calls
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Path Semantics}: A path $p = [m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n]$ from root to leaf represents a complete conversation flow. Trees with multiple paths represent:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Different response attempts (ChatGPT regenerations)
    \item User exploring alternatives (forking conversations)
    \item Parallel conversation branches (multi-turn exploration)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Universal Representation}

The tree model achieves universality by handling special cases:

\textbf{Linear Conversations}: A tree with single path $(m_1) \rightarrow (m_2) \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow (m_n)$ representing traditional turn-taking dialogue.

\textbf{Branching Conversations}: Trees with multiple children per node, capturing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Regenerated responses with different content
    \item Forked conversations exploring different directions
    \item Assistant providing multiple alternative answers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multi-Modal Content}: Messages support heterogeneous content:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Text with markdown, code, LaTeX
    \item Images (uploaded or generated)
    \item Tool calls and results (function calling)
    \item Audio/video (future modalities)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metadata and Organization}

Each conversation tree carries metadata:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Provenance}: Source platform, model used, creation time
    \item \textbf{Organization}: Tags, projects, starred/pinned/archived status
    \item \textbf{Analytics}: Message counts, token usage, conversation duration
    \item \textbf{Custom Fields}: Extensible key-value storage
\end{itemize}

This metadata enables sophisticated filtering, analysis, and organization beyond what individual platforms provide.

\section{System Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

\subsection{Architectural Principles}

CTK's architecture follows these design principles:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Layered Design}: Clear separation between data models, storage, business logic, and interfaces
    \item \textbf{Plugin-Based Extensibility}: New formats added without modifying core
    \item \textbf{Privacy First}: No network dependencies except optional LLM features
    \item \textbf{Single Responsibility}: Each component has one well-defined purpose
    \item \textbf{Progressive Complexity}: Simple operations are simple, complex operations possible
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Four-Layer Architecture}

\textbf{Layer 1: Data Layer}

Persistent storage using SQLite with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conversations table: Core metadata and organization fields
    \item Messages table: Content and tree structure (parent\_id references)
    \item Tags table: Many-to-many tagging system
    \item Paths table: Cached complete paths for performance
\end{itemize}

SQLite provides ACID guarantees, portability, and excellent performance up to 100K+ conversations.

\textbf{Layer 2: Plugin Layer}

Extensible plugin system with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Importers}: Convert platform-specific formats to conversation trees
    \item \textbf{Exporters}: Convert trees to various output formats
    \item \textbf{LLM Providers}: Unified interface to multiple LLM APIs
    \item \textbf{Auto-Discovery}: Plugins loaded dynamically at runtime
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Layer 3: Core Logic Layer}

Business logic including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Database operations: CRUD with transaction management
    \item Search and filtering: Full-text search, metadata filtering
    \item Organization: Starring, pinning, archiving, tagging
    \item Analytics: Statistics, trends, usage patterns
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Layer 4: Interface Layer}

Multiple interfaces for different workflows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CLI}: Command-line for scripting and automation
    \item \textbf{TUI}: Interactive terminal UI for exploration
    \item \textbf{REST API}: HTTP interface for web applications
    \item \textbf{Python API}: Library for programmatic access
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Flow}

\textbf{Import Pipeline}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User provides file and optional format hint
    \item Format detection: Try each importer's \texttt{validate()} method
    \item Parsing: Selected importer converts to conversation trees
    \item Normalization: Ensure all required fields present
    \item Storage: Persist trees to database with metadata
    \item Indexing: Update search indices and cached paths
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Query Pipeline}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User query (natural language or structured)
    \item For natural language: LLM interprets query and selects tools
    \item Database query: Execute search/filter operations
    \item Result ranking: Sort by relevance, recency, or custom criteria
    \item Presentation: Format for output (table, JSON, detailed view)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Export Pipeline}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select conversations (all, filtered, or specific IDs)
    \item Load trees from database
    \item Path selection: Choose which paths to export (longest, all, etc.)
    \item Format conversion: Exporter transforms trees to target format
    \item Optional sanitization: Remove sensitive data
    \item Write output: File, stdout, or API response
\end{enumerate}

\section{Key Features and Design Decisions}
\label{sec:features}

\subsection{Natural Language Queries}

\subsubsection{The Tool Calling Approach}

Traditional keyword search assumes users know exact terms. CTK enables natural language queries like:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Show me starred conversations from last month''
    \item ``Find discussions about Python async programming''
    \item ``What conversations mention machine learning?''
\end{itemize}

Implementation uses LLM tool calling:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User provides natural language query
    \item LLM receives query with tool descriptions
    \item LLM selects appropriate tool (search, filter, get-by-id)
    \item LLM generates tool parameters from query
    \item System executes tool, returns results directly
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Critical Design Pattern: Direct Output}

Early versions let the LLM reformulate results, causing hallucination. Solution: Return tool results directly to user without LLM reformatting. This ensures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No invented conversations
    \item Exact database results
    \item Consistent formatting
    \item Verifiable outputs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Boolean Filter Semantics}

Careful handling of optional boolean filters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Filter absent}: Include all (no filtering)
    \item \textbf{Filter = true}: Include only items with flag
    \item \textbf{Filter = false}: Include only items without flag
\end{itemize}

System prompt includes explicit rules preventing LLM from incorrectly adding filters not mentioned in query.

\subsection{Interactive Terminal UI}

The TUI provides real-time conversation management:

\textbf{Design Philosophy}: Combine browsing, organization, and live chat in single interface. Users can:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Browse conversations with rich formatting (colors, emojis)
    \item Search and filter with instant feedback
    \item Star/pin/archive conversations inline
    \item View conversation trees with path navigation
    \item Start live chat with LLMs while browsing
    \item Export selected conversations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Innovations}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Context Switching}: Seamlessly move between browsing historical conversations and chatting with LLMs
    \item \textbf{Tree Visualization}: ASCII art trees showing branching structure
    \item \textbf{Path Navigation}: Step through different paths in branching conversations
    \item \textbf{Inline Organization}: Modify metadata without leaving view
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Privacy and Sanitization}

\textbf{Privacy-First Architecture}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No telemetry or analytics
    \item All data stored locally
    \item No network access except optional LLM features
    \item No cloud sync (user controls if/how data is backed up)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sanitization for Sharing}:

Optional sanitization removes sensitive data before export:
\begin{itemize}
    \item API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, etc.)
    \item Passwords and authentication tokens
    \item SSH keys and certificates
    \item Database connection strings
    \item Credit card numbers
    \item Custom patterns via regex
\end{itemize}

This enables sharing conversation datasets for research while protecting user privacy.

\subsection{Organization Strategies}

\textbf{Starring}: Mark important conversations for quick access. Common uses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conversations with valuable insights
    \item Reference solutions to recurring problems
    \item Conversations to review later
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pinning}: Keep conversations at top of lists. Use cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Active projects
    \item Frequently accessed templates
    \item Ongoing discussions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Archiving}: Hide old conversations without deleting. Preserves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conversation history for compliance
    \item Old experiments and explorations
    \item Resolved issues (might be relevant later)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Tagging}: Flexible categorization with auto-tagging:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual tags for custom categories
    \item Automatic tags from platform, model, date
    \item LLM-generated tags from content analysis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Design Decision: Timestamps Over Booleans}

Instead of \texttt{starred: bool}, use \texttt{starred\_at: timestamp}. Benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Preserves when operation occurred
    \item Enables sorting by recency of star
    \item Supports analytics (starring trends over time)
    \item Minimal additional complexity
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

\subsection{Dataset}

Evaluation uses real user data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 851 conversations across platforms
    \item 25,890 total messages
    \item 87\% linear, 13\% branching conversations
    \item Sources: ChatGPT (50\%), Claude (34\%), Gemini (11\%), Copilot (5\%)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Import Accuracy}

Table~\ref{tab:import-accuracy} shows import success rates:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Platform & Conversations & Messages & Branches & Accuracy \\
\midrule
OpenAI & 423 & 12,847 & 156 & 100\% \\
Anthropic & 287 & 9,102 & 0 & 100\% \\
Gemini & 95 & 2,873 & 0 & 100\% \\
JSONL & 34 & 856 & 0 & 100\% \\
Copilot & 12 & 212 & 0 & 95\%* \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Import accuracy by platform. *Copilot format varies by version.}
\label{tab:import-accuracy}
\end{table}

\textbf{Analysis}: High accuracy across platforms demonstrates universality of tree model. Copilot's 95\% reflects format variability across VS Code versions.

\subsection{Natural Language Query Performance}

Evaluated on 100 diverse queries:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Query Type & Success Rate & Avg Time \\
\midrule
Simple filter (starred/pinned) & 98\% & 0.3s \\
Keyword search & 94\% & 0.8s \\
Combined (keyword + filter) & 91\% & 0.9s \\
Complex multi-filter & 87\% & 1.1s \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Natural language query accuracy and latency}
\label{tab:query-performance}
\end{table}

\textbf{Error Analysis}: The 2-13\% failure rate comes from:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ambiguous queries (``recent'' without timeframe)
    \item Unusual phrasings outside training distribution
    \item Complex boolean logic (``not starred but pinned or archived'')
\end{itemize}

Future work: Improve with query clarification dialogue.

\subsection{Database Performance}

Performance scales well to 100K+ conversations:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Operation & Time (851 conv) & Scaling \\
\midrule
Import 1K messages & 2.1s & Linear \\
Load conversation & 15ms & Constant \\
Full-text search & 45ms & Log(n) \\
Filtered list & 8ms & Log(n) \\
Export 100 conv & 1.3s & Linear \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Performance characteristics}
\label{tab:performance}
\end{table}

SQLite with proper indexing provides excellent performance. Future optimization: SQLite FTS5 for full-text search.

\subsection{User Study}

Informal user feedback (N=15) over 3 months:

\textbf{Positive Feedback}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Finally can search across all my AI conversations''
    \item ``Natural language queries feel magical''
    \item ``Tree visualization helps understand ChatGPT branches''
    \item ``Export to JSONL for fine-tuning is invaluable''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Feature Requests}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Semantic similarity search (beyond keyword)
    \item Web interface for mobile access
    \item Automatic conversation summarization
    \item Cross-conversation topic threads
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Lessons Learned}

\subsubsection{Universality Through Trees}

The tree representation proved more universal than anticipated. Every conversation format encountered fits naturally:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear conversations: Single-path trees (trivial case)
    \item ChatGPT branches: Natural branching at regeneration points
    \item Tool-using agents: Tool calls as special message content
    \item Multi-modal: Content heterogeneity separate from tree structure
\end{itemize}

This suggests trees are the \emph{right abstraction} for conversations, not just a convenient compromise.

\subsubsection{Tool Calling for Interpretation}

Using LLM tool calling for query interpretation works remarkably well but requires careful design:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Explicit Instructions}: System prompts must be specific, not suggestive
    \item \textbf{Few-Shot Examples}: Examples prevent unwanted behaviors more than instructions
    \item \textbf{Direct Output}: Never let LLM reformulate tool results
    \item \textbf{Parameter Semantics}: Clear distinction between ``omit'' and ``false''
\end{itemize}

This pattern likely applies to many domains beyond conversation management.

\subsubsection{Plugin Architecture Benefits}

Auto-discovery of plugins provided unexpected benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Community Contributions}: Users can add format support independently
    \item \textbf{Rapid Prototyping}: New formats added in < 1 hour
    \item \textbf{Format Evolution}: Platform changes don't require core updates
    \item \textbf{Specialization}: Domain-specific formats (e.g., medical AI logs) easily supported
\end{itemize}

The cost---dynamic loading complexity---is minimal compared to benefits.

\subsection{Design Trade-offs}

\subsubsection{SQLite vs. Specialized Databases}

Choosing SQLite over alternatives:

\textbf{Advantages}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Zero configuration, single file
    \item Excellent performance (< 100K conversations)
    \item ACID guarantees
    \item Universal availability
    \item Simple backup (copy file)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited full-text search capabilities
    \item No native vector similarity
    \item Single-writer (fine for personal use)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Verdict}: Correct choice for personal knowledge management. For enterprise use cases, might consider PostgreSQL.

\subsubsection{Local-First vs. Cloud-Sync}

CTK is deliberately local-first:

\textbf{Why Local-First Wins}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Privacy: User controls all data
    \item Latency: Zero network delay
    \item Reliability: Works offline
    \item Simplicity: No sync conflicts
    \item Cost: Zero ongoing fees
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cloud-Sync Considerations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users can use Dropbox/iCloud for sync
    \item Git works well for SQLite files
    \item Future: Optional end-to-end encrypted sync
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Directions}

\subsubsection{Semantic Similarity Search}

Current search is keyword-based. Future: Vector embeddings for semantic similarity.

\textbf{Approach}: Integrate with complex-network-rag package:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Path-level embeddings (not whole conversations)
    \item Network topology analysis (communities, bridges)
    \item Query expansion using similarity
    \item Cross-conversation topic threads
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conversation Analytics}

Beyond basic statistics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Topic evolution over time
    \item Model comparison (which answers better?)
    \item Conversation quality metrics
    \item Token usage optimization
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Collaborative Features}

While maintaining privacy focus:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shared conversation collections (research teams)
    \item Conversation templates (best practices)
    \item Federated search (optional)
    \item Privacy-preserving analytics
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Advanced Organization}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hierarchical projects/folders
    \item Conversation relationships (related, supersedes, references)
    \item Smart collections (dynamic queries saved as views)
    \item Workflow integration (link to tasks, notes)
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

CTK demonstrates that unified conversation management across AI platforms is both feasible and valuable. By introducing a universal tree-based representation, we enable operations impossible within any single platform: cross-platform search, comparative analysis, flexible organization, and dataset preparation.

The system's success---851 conversations managed with 95-100\% import accuracy, sub-second query performance, and positive user feedback---validates the core design decisions: tree-based universality, plugin-based extensibility, and local-first privacy.

Key contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Universal Model}: Tree representation handling diverse conversation types
    \item \textbf{Natural Language Interface}: Tool calling approach for intuitive queries
    \item \textbf{Practical System}: Production-ready with multiple interfaces and formats
    \item \textbf{Design Patterns}: Lessons applicable beyond conversation management
\end{enumerate}

As AI assistants become ubiquitous, conversation management will grow in importance. CTK provides a foundation for treating conversational knowledge with the same rigor as documents, code, and research---as valuable artifacts worthy of careful curation, organization, and preservation.
